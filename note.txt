To demonstrate the process of deep learning through a simple example, we can use a basic neural network trained to recognize handwritten digits, a common task in machine learning. Here are the steps involved:
1.	Data Collection: Gather a dataset of handwritten digits. Each digit is typically represented as a grayscale image.
2.	Data Preprocessing: Normalize the images so that the pixel values are scaled to a range, usually between 0 and 1. This helps in faster convergence during training.
3.	Model Design: Create a neural network model. This can be a simple network with a few layers for a basic task like digit recognition.

4.	Model Training:
•	Forward Propagation: Pass an input (digit image) through the network to get a prediction.
•	Loss Calculation: Compare the prediction with the actual label using a loss function to determine the error.
•	Backpropagation: Calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network by moving backwards through the network.
•	Weight Update: Adjust the weights of the network using the gradients to reduce the loss.

5.	Evaluation: Test the model on a separate set of data not used in training to evaluate its performance.
6.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, number of layers, and number of neurons to improve the model.
7.	Deployment: Once the model performs satisfactorily, deploy it for real-world use.
8.	Feedback Loop: Collect feedback from the real-world use and use it to further refine the model.
This process represents a high-level overview and can vary based on the complexity of the task and the chosen model.
